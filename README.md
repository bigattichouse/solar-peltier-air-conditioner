**Test Room:**

Room is on the North side of our house (1850s, room was added around 1917), it has two exposed walls and an exposed flat roof, typically getting quite hot in the afternoon when the sun is in the west we do have a tree there.  Tree was damaged in a storm, so a bit less cooling in the late afternoon.
