**First Run:**

First run, 4:14pm June 14,2024 to 9:00am June 16, 2024 No A/C until 9:08am on June 15th. 

We'd lost power in storms the night before, but only established cooling around 330pm. The door was open, so a very strong influence from A/Cs in other parts of the house. I let it run from 4pm until morning, and switched on the A/C. It consistently blew cooler air (by 3-5 degrees F) while on.

**Second Run:**

I am now running the same test, but this time the room is closed up. I don't expect the A/C to cool the room so much as keep it a few degrees cooler than it would be.
